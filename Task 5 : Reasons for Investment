This repository contains Task 5 from my Power BI internship at Cognifyz, focusing on analyzing the reasons why people invest. The goal was to identify the most common investment motivations and visualize the key factors influencing investor decisions.

Key Insights:
Capital Appreciation is the primary reason for investing, indicating that most investors prioritize long-term financial growth.
Assured Returns and Better Returns are also significant motivators, suggesting that investors seek stability alongside profitability.
Risk-Free and Fixed Returns investments attract a notable portion of investors, showcasing a preference for secure investment options.
Fund Diversification and Safe Investment are important considerations, highlighting risk management strategies.
Tax Benefits and Liquidity are among the least common reasons, indicating that tax-saving investments are not a primary driver for most investors.
This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive and data-driven approach to understanding what drives investment decisions, helping businesses and financial advisors align their strategies with investor priorities.
