This repository contains the second task from my Power BI internship at Cognifyz, focusing on gender-based investment analysis. The objective of this task was to explore how investment preferences, saving objectives, and financial behaviors vary between male and female investors.

Key Insights:
Out of 1120 investors, 62.5% are male, and 37.5% are female.
Male investors show a stronger preference for Mutual Funds and Equity, while female investors prefer Fixed Deposits and PPF (Public Provident Fund).
The primary saving objective for both genders is Retirement Planning, but female investors also have a higher inclination towards Health Care savings.
Investment monitoring frequency varies, with a majority of investors reviewing their investments monthly, while fewer monitor them on a weekly or daily basis.
The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive visualization of these insights, allowing for a clear understanding of gender-based financial behaviors and investment trends.
