This repository contains the third task from my Power BI internship at Cognifyz, focusing on investment objective analysis. The goal of this task was to analyze and visualize the key financial objectives driving investment decisions among individuals.

Key Insights:
The top investment objective is Retirement Planning, with a significant number of investors prioritizing long-term financial security.
Health Care savings is the second most common objective, indicating a growing concern for medical expenses.
Education savings is a relatively less common objective, suggesting that most investors focus on wealth accumulation and security rather than education-related expenses.
The dashboard enables interactive exploration of different investment objectives across various demographics and financial behaviors.
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive breakdown of why people invest, helping identify major financial goals and trends among investors.
