This repository contains Task 7 from my Power BI internship at Cognifyz, where I created a comprehensive dashboard that integrates insights from all previous analyses. The goal was to design a single, interactive dashboard that provides a holistic view of investment trends, investor behavior, and financial decision-making patterns.

Key Features:
Consolidated Insights: The dashboard brings together findings from investment preferences, gender-based analysis, investment duration, saving objectives, reasons for investing, and information sources into a unified view.
Interactive Visualizations: Users can filter data by gender, investment type, saving goals, and monitoring frequency to explore insights dynamically.
Trend Analysis: Identifies key investment trends across different demographics, helping businesses and analysts understand investor behavior.
User-Friendly Design: The dashboard layout is structured for clear readability and easy navigation, ensuring efficient data exploration.
Key Insights:
Majority of investors prefer long-term investments (5+ years) with monthly monitoring of their portfolios.
Retirement Planning and Capital Appreciation are the top investment objectives.
Financial Consultants and Newspapers are the most trusted sources of investment information.
Men prefer riskier investment options (Mutual Funds & Equity), whereas women lean towards safer options (Fixed Deposits & PPF).
This final Power BI dashboard serves as an interactive and data-driven decision-making tool, providing valuable insights into investor behavior, financial motivations, and market trends
